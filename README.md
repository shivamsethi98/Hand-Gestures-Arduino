# Hand-Gestures-Arduino
Arduino Based  Hand Gestures Computer Control using HC-SR04(Ultrasonic Sensor)

For Controlling of The PC I have used PyAutoGUI which reads the data from arduino file using Serial Communication and gives the appropriate  response

Each application has different set of Hotkeys which gives different responses

I have coded the gestures only for 2 applications- chrome and vlc

Through The uploaded python code we can successfully test the gestures for the both softwares

For Testing the program just run The Arduino code first and then the python code and input the app name(chrome or vlc)

Each gestures works under when the hands are placed at a specific area , the conditions can be by understood by reading the Arduino code
